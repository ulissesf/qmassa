TODO
====

These are the high prio ordered tasks for 1.0 release, IMO. The TODO in the
code are considered nice to have or just possibilities.

1. get to first decent UI, fix layout bugs/hardcoded constraints
1. reduce amount of UI updates
1. dump raw data in json/csv format
1. get vendor/device strings based on PCI IDs
1. reduce memory usage (add more Option<> fields, store refs and not owned vals) == learn more Rust and revamp everything again? :-)
