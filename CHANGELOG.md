## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/ulissesf/qmassa/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2024-11-26

### Features

- GPU power reporting for AMD dGPUs through Hwmon. (@ulissesf)
- Display charts for all device statistics available. (@ulissesf)

- Minor UI improvements: better readability of long engine names; frozen headers in the DRM clients list. (@ulissesf)

### Fixes

- Do not override PL1 with Status in frequency chart. (@ulissesf)

## [v0.2.3](https://github.com/ulissesf/qmassa/releases/tag/v0.2.3) - 2024-11-11
